The code 'run_analysis' is meant to do the following:

1 - Merge training and the test sets to create one data set.                    
2 - Extracts only measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.                                                                #
3 - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.     
4 - Appropriately lables the data set with descriptive variables names.         
5 - From the data in part 4, creates a second, indepdent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
