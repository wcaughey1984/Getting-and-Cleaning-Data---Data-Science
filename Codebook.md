Getting and cleaning data - final project
=========================================================

## Original data
The data used in this project is from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.html).  This data was collected through accelerometers and gyroscopes in Samsung Galaxy S smartphones.  

The data is separated into two distinct sets: training and test sets.  The training set is approximately 70% of the total sample.  This set is used to train and tune models that will be applied to the model.  The test set contains 30% of the sample.  This set is used to test how well the model performs after it is trained and tune.

## run_analysis.R
This code downloads, merges, and exports a final data set.  This final data set contains the final means for selected fields by subject and activity.  See the 'Readme.md' for further information.
